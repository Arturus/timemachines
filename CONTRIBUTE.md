# Time-machines contributors guide

Hello, we hope you are interested in helping us create free open short term prediction of anything for anyone.

## Goals 
 
The goals of the timemachines package:

   - Make available a large slew of fully autonomous univariate forecasting functions ("skaters")
   - Evaluate them continuously over fresh, live, diverse real-world timeseries (search "time-series Elo ratings")
   - Create fast surrogates, stacking, compositions and so forth. 
   - Stick some of them in "crawlers" than operate in real-time and predict time-series at www.microprediction.org
   - Thereby provide free high quality short-term prediction to anyone, anywhere, for any reason

## Friday chats

If you would like to help, the various CONTRIBUTE_ files suggest very specific steps you can take. However the following
initial step is strongly recommended: 

  - Grab the slack invite from the [knowledge center](https://www.microprediction.com/knowledge-center)
  - Turn up to one of the informal chats we have every Friday noon EST. 
  - If that timezone is bad, maybe Tue 8pm EST. 
  
But if you are shy that's fine too.
